    "Neural network consists of few layers of perceptrons. Each perceptron simulates the operation of neuron. It collects input variables $x_i$, weights them with coefficients $w_i$, and sums the result to one value. The output value is obtained by scaling the sum between values 0...1 by using an activation function. For classification, the activation function is binary step function, and for regression, it is continuous, like sigmoid function. The neuron can be teached by updating the weights $w_i$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based on perceptrons, are versatile machine learning methods for both regression and classification. Deep and dense networks can learn to handle complex tasks, but the deeper the network, the more training data is needed.\n",
    "- Deep learning can be implemented using many hidden layers in ANN. Deep learning requires large amount of training data.\n",
    "- Deep learning is often used for image processing with convolutional neural networks\n",
    "- Keras and PyTorch are common libraries for implementing deep learning. They can utilize both CPU:s and NVidia GPU:s for training and predicting"
